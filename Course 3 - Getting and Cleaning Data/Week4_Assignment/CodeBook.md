## Tidy data set description
The variables in the tidy data
Tidy data contains 180 rows and 81 columns. Each row has averaged variables for each subject and each activity.

## Focus on the mean- and stdev-variables
A selection of features was made by looking at those containing the following strings:
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
The data were grouped by subject id and activity, then averaged over them.

There are 30 distinct subjects in the datasets denoted by subject_id 1 to 30. 
There are 6 different types of activities:
* WALKING
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
* SITTING
* STANDING
* LAYING

The tidy data contains 6 rows (averaged based on activity) and 81 columns (79 variables and activity labels):
